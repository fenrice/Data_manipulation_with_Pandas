Subsetting rows
A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.

dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]
You can filter for multiple conditions at once by using the "logical and" operator, &.

dogs[(dogs["height_cm"] > 60) & (dogs["col_b"] == "tan")]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.
'''
# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = homelessness[homelessness["individuals"]>10000]

# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)

# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness["region"]=="Mountain"]

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000 
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness["family_members"] < 1000) & (homelessness["region"] == "Pacific")]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)
